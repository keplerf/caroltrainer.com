                Before starting any training program, it's important to
                understand where you are right now. That's what a fitness
                assessment is for! It gives a clear picture of your current
                health and fitness level — including things like heart rate,
                blood pressure, height, weight, and simple movement or strength
                tests.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your personal trainer Carol will also chat with you about your
                workout history, goals, and what you actually enjoy doing (and
                what you don't!). With this information, Carol can build a safe,
                effective, and personalized plan that helps you move better,
                feel stronger, and reach your goals faster — all while making
                fitness something you look forward to.

                The first session is all about you. We'll start with a
                conversation about your goals, fitness history, and any injuries
                or limitations. Then I'll guide you through a few simple
                movement assessments to see how your body moves. You'll finish
                the session with a customized workout and a clear plan forward
                based on your needs.

                That depends on your goals and schedule. Many clients start with
                1-3 sessions per week and complement those with their own
                workouts using the customized plan I create for them. The key is
                consistency, not perfection.

                That's very common—and something I specialize in. With over 20

                work around injuries while improving your strength and mobility
